LSP version 0.01
================

LSP stands for 'LÃ©xico Semantico do Portugues'. LSP is a project that is being 
developed with the main purpose of creating a corpus for the Portuguese 
language based on other previous developed tools. These tools include hard 
tested databases with morphological information as the Jspell, as well as 
community-edit resources as the Wikipedia and the Wiktionary.
Apart the morphological information gathered from the previous mentioned tools, 
the LSP has also semantic information from different sources:
 - Manually inserted semantic information
 - Semantic information gathered using the Window Rules (see ASP project)
 - In future, semantic information from the Wikipedia and Wiktionary, both for 
  the Portuguese language. 

This project has two main features that characterize it:
 - The portability: A fully independent database (LSPDB) is generated based on 
 	the morphological and semantic information. It is stored in a plain-text 
 	file to avoid complex access and search procedures.
 - The performance: Since the database is stored as a plain-text, it can be 
 	entirely loaded to the system's memory. The database uses hashs to attain 
 	high performance in search operations.
